# petrophysics-labs

This repository contains a collection of petrophysics lab works focused on well log interpretation and core petrophysical calculations. The labs are implemented using Python and cover topics such as porosity estimation, shale volume calculation, fluid saturation, and lithology identification.

The notebooks utilize tools such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, and `seaborn` for numerical analysis and data visualization. Where applicable, basic optimization techniques and empirical models are used to analyze and interpret geophysical well log data.

These labs are part of an academic learning process and are structured as a pet project to combine geoscience knowledge with practical Python skills.
